1) Venv is easier to manage than pipenv
2) If you are using sqlite3 in your settings, navigate to 
venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py
and change line 65 to "pass"
3) You will need to manually configure all the routes using 
the console to avoid using a proxy to your lambda
4) Check the zappa settings of latest repo
5) Ensure zappa settings is not committed to git
6) After the initial deployment with "zappa deploy", you will
need to change the allowed host before all can be well
7) No need to configure CORS(app-wise), I think. Zappa settings
provides this configuration.
8) Use django when working with a relational DB. If you need to
run script which is invoked through an API, use flask. I do not
think fast api has a zappa integration.
